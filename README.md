# Higher-Lower-Number-Game
There is a common guessing game where the computer picks a random number, and then it is the player's task to guess the number. The computer will only provide feedback such as "Too low" or "Too high", and the player has to guess again. Obviously, when the player finally picks the correct number then the player is congratulated and the game ends. It is your task to create the game.
